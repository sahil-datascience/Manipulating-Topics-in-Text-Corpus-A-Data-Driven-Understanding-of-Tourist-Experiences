It runs east to west alongside the Mall Road, and joins it at the Scandal Point on the west side. On the east side, The Ridge road leads to Lakkar Bazaar, a wooden crafts market. The Ridge houses a large water reservoir which acts as the main supply of Shimla town. 

One can do horse riding here. Sit here and enjoy the cool and clear environment with Himalayas views. Many hawkers sells eatables that makes the place a bit dirty.  

The Ridge road is also the venue for Summer festival, government functions and local celebrations during New Year's Eve. Prominent landmarks on The Ridge include Christ Church built in the 1850s and a library building built in 1910. There are three statues on The Ridge- that of Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Dr. Y.S. Parmar, the first Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh."

You just need to climb up to Old Shimla which is a real Jem. Old Shimla is exact opposite of New Shimla. Places to visit here are few but I guarantee that the people seeking for peaceful holiday would definitely love this place. Now, as my review is about The Ridge let me tell you that you will feel like you are back in British Raj because of its divine ChristChruch standing tall on the Ridge and also because of the old colonial buildings built by Britishers which are now converted to restaurants and shops.

Things not to be missed- Delicious Pastries and lip-smacking non-veg food especially mutton kebabs at Baljees which is located just opposite to the Nagar Nigam of shimla. This place is heaven for photography buffs because of the beautiful backdrop provided by this place. You can also visit hanuman temple(i forgot the name) which stands at the peak over the ridge but be ready to experience a stressful walk of i think 3-4 kms because the road is very steepy.

Vehicles are not allowed in Old shimla so brace yourselves to walk if you really want to discover this place..ya horses are available but according to me strolling through the ridge is better option because you wont enjoy the ride as it is too much costly and you'll get really tired after the ride so dont waste money on horseride instead use them wisely on food or buying books at the bookshops..ya these bookshops have wide variety of classic books.

In a nutshell, I would recommend you to visit this place once in a lifetime, you'll respect the Britishers for the heritage they have left behind for us..."

Beware of people who come and ask whether you need a cab for 1 day, 2 day sightseeing trip. They are unreliable and I have heard of few people having very bad experience with such people, just ignore them.

They have different options as well. If you just want a drop they will charge INR 200-250 and for a one hour stroll through the market with you they charge INR 400. I took the service of a guy Pratap and he was decent enough to be with. Took me through the bylanes and then gave me a drop at Ridge. While returning I just gave him a call and he dropped me back.

Depending on the weather, the time of the day and the part which you are exploring, it can range from a bustling meeting place( you are in good company, the Maharaja of Patiala and the Viceroys daughter used to catch up here at Scandal Point) or a lonely walk among abandoned cottages and wayward pines if you choose to wander off the many offshoots esp near the  Grand Hotel end. Find the spot below the State Bank building which introduces you to all the colonial landmarks and follow the trail by yourself!

A 15 minute walk from The Mall, as you pass by Lakkar Bazar and Scandal Point, the scenic spot is a photographer's paradise, especially if the valley is covered with snow or with clouds. The large open spaces, the Large Clock tower and the panoramic view of the tree covered hills, with the iconic Hanuman idol of the Jakhu Temple standing out in contrast.
You'd often see most families taking group photos and selfies with the valley as the backdrop. Kids can go for the horse/pony ride conveniently available.
Tips for first timers- from lower Shimla, there is a public lift available @Rs. 20 that can get you up to Mall Road, beyond which you can only walk upto the Ridge. For small kids, pls do not forget to take the prams available for 150-200 Rs for 2 hours- it's an uphill climb to the Ridge, and you will be dog tired if you have to carry your little ones along. Parking is a problem on most days, especially around the lift area, so it might make sense to get the hotel can to drop and pick you up anywhere near the lift area.
Plenty of places to shop around the Mall, nothing special to buy though. Eateries are limited, you can get a Pizza (Dominos) shop, and some local fast food and ice cream shops. Folks who like their history (as spicy as it comes), do not forget the Book store next to Scandal Point!"

We saw the statues of Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Y.S. Parmar, the first Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh as we strolled around. On one side there is an open balcony from where we got a beautiful view of the distant Himalayan ranges which get covered with snow in the winters. 

Very few tourists, standing on the Ridge, may be aware that below their feet are the water reservoirs that supply drinking water to the city of Shimla. These water tanks were built here during the British era.

A walk along the promenade from the Mall to the Ridge is a must if you happen to visit Shimla. This place is also free from all vehicular traffic so one can walk carefree."

The busy plaza is flanked by neatly tended and attractive parks, dotted with statues of the great and good from Shimla and the broader India beyond. There are plenty of park benches and, at their outer railings, the parks give onto sweeping views in all directions of the dramatic wooded hills interspersed with picturesquely piled terraces of houses and, in the distance, the snow-capped peaks of the high Himalaya.
Monkeys, mynas and black kites can be seen perching in the high trees and on the corrugated rooves.
The whole area has a holiday atmosphere with roaming vendors selling chai, candyfloss, balloons and snacks; horse rides; food and drink stalls and families picnicking.
An exhilarating place to visit."

Someone visiting for the first time is totally enthralled by the view.
Where ever you want to go in and around Shimla, the tourist information bureau can give you all the concerned details. In summers you have to go to the ridge in the evenings, with the people gathered together there seems that some festival is going on. The band stand is playing the band, the summer festival too takes place there only.Another attraction that fascinates the visitors is that if you want people to enjoy your singing talent, on a nominal payment the microphone is yours, and you can make people enjoy your talent for free. In winters, again, the ridge presents another view, people of all age groups are busy throwing snow balls at each other . To top everything, the sight on the new year eve, my goodness!!!!! One can see the maximum crowd ever. One group doing dancing , another one singing Bollywood tune,even another one singing English songs,going through this whole crowd is an effort.

If you talk of Shimla, it would be incomplete without mentioning this place. The Ridge road is a large open space and is the hub of all cultural activities of Shimla. It is situated along the Mall Road, which is the famous shopping center of Shimla. Most major places of Shimla like Snowdon, Mall, Jakhoo hill, etc. are connected through the Ridge.

It runs east to west alongside the Mall Road, and joins it at the Scandal Point on the west side. On the east side, The Ridge road leads to Lakkar Bazaar, a wooden crafts market. It's the major landmark and the most easily recognized face of the hill station. When winter sets in and Shimla experiences its first major snowfall of the year, most news papers print photos of the ridge submerged in clumps of fresh snow.

Prominent landmarks on the Ridge are a neo-Gothic Christ church built in 1844 and a library building built in 1910. There are various statues on the ridge like that of Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, and Dr. Y.S. Parmar, the first chief minister of Himachal Pradesh.

The ridge of Shimla had the thickest forest of the area at one time. Now the green slopes are covered with firs, pines, Himalayan oak and carmine rhododendron trees."

It is a vast pedestrian-only open area ringed by metallic railings.  All around there are impressive buildings, including the Christ Church and the stone-built Town Hall. People can also find neatly tended and attractive parks, and statues of local and national leaders. From the railings, they can have sweeping views in all directions of the dramatic wooded hills, interspersed with picturesquely tiled terraces of houses and in the distance the snow-capped peaks of the high Himalayas.  People throng the place always.  The Ridge comes alive during the times of snowfall, when people in warm clothes can be seen skiing and throwing balls of snow at others. 

As vehicles are not allowed into it, visitors have to climb approach streets, which are somewhat steep but well paved, to reach it.   From the Ridge the famous 108-foot Jakhu Hill Hanuman statue can be seen emerging out of the greenery in the distance. 

It is a good place for the young and the old to hang out or walk around leisurely enjoying a cone of ice cream.   It is one of the most photographed areas of Shimla."

The place is full of positive energy as the local people carry on with their daily affair. Children nicely groomed and dressed in uniform walking all the way through the mall to their schools on the ridge (no vehicles, not even bicycles in this area) look cheerful with their pink cheeks. Some little grown ups stop by for a cricket match of 2 overs to give themselves a few minutes of break to scale next elevation of walk. No sleepy or dull faces, they look brimming with enthusiasm. Watching people passby, some taking a stroll, some going for their work, seniors chit-chatting and flipping through newspaper, all are relaxed but motivated. A porter finds enough strength to load 2 filled indane gas cylinders on his back but not beg or steal, I have not seen a beggar here yet. While they intend to reach their destination in time, they find time to greet and stop for a minute of conversation if any one known comes across. As the Indian flag flies high at the ridge, the place as cleanly maintained as this, with natural beauty around, cultured and respectful people, this is a true salute to the spirit of flag and statues it hoists. While the beautiful views of the valley from the ridge and shopping across the mall are well known tourist attractions, this experience of just watching the life move on in this beautiful town of Shimla has been amazing and really rejuvenating. As the day passes and sun brightens, people may get to deal with the challenges in their lives, but I am sure they lift themselves up with great spirit every next morning. While we may see very beautiful places in the world, the wonderful people make of beautiful experience and I have just had one today morning. As the 10am siren sounds loud and mall road shop shutters open up, I get up from my bench with by now emptied four tea cups and head back to my hotel to accomplish my tourist sightseeing targets for the day with my family, probably including more touristy, over-crowded ridge in the evening with many hawkers around."
