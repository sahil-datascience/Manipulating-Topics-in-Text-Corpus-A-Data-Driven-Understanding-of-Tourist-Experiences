The Mall extends the value and beauty of Shimla.
The Mall consists lots of administrative buildings and public service offices of valuable architecture. The design, shape and structure of buildings can make you think that you are in an European city. Don't miss to take these buildings pictures as these might not be found in any other places of india.

Also there are some temple in Mall. There is a very nice Christ Church and also the Ridge.The view from the Ridge is very scenic and you can feel the natural beauty of Shimla from there.

For shopping lovers, it is like a paradise. Lots of branded shops are available here. 

There is a lift and one can use that lift to go to the Mall.

One must visit this place in morning or afternoon as the buildings beauty can be felt in that time. Also one should visit this place in night when the place has different charms.

I visited this place in september,2010."

However if you are visiting for the 'n'th time, then this place has lost its charm.
Three friends walked around the mall road on a Sunday morning - afternoon with little to do. You can look at shops (warning - many branded shops like Tommy Arrows etc are shut on sundays). The local shops are too expensive (rates would suit only foreigners). The mall has lost its charm in a way. It has some very nice photography points which may interest you. 
Overall i suggest you spend not more than a couple of hours here and find some nice eating joints or trail off into the interiors instead. :)"

Since my late father was with the Punjab govt. of undivided India, we were in Shimla for almost 6 months of the year- getting there in early April and leaving Shimla in the end of Sept.6 months of my growing years, every year, were spent in Shimla.
 From 1938 to 1947 we were staying in the compound of Barnes Court, the summer house of the governor of Punjab of undivided India.
I had vivid memories of Shimla. My family, specially my older brother and sisters, used to recall the places we knew well in & around Shimla. 
In my last visit with my wife in 2004, I was pleasently surprised that most of the heretage places, were kept and maintained verywell. The Gaity theater was in the process of renovatin in the same shape and style.We were able to visit the HP, governor's place of residence (old Barnes Court) and see where the famous Simla agreement was signed by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto & Indra Ghandhi. So we have decided to visit Shimla again this summer instead of goving to USA or Europe for our holidays."

Shimla is a large working town and the Mall is primarily for their benefit.  So saying, it is nicely done with a broad-walk with interesting views on both sides.  At various points are the historical buildings renovated to maintain the heritage.  Additions are in the same design, so town planning here is important.  The Post Office looks like an English 1930s department store with a Scottish castle turret !?  It must be India, because you would never see that in UK. The turret builders must have been popular in Shimla in their day because you see these turrets elsewhere in the town. Other buildings are straight from Victorian Scotland.  The 'Scottish' kirk behind the Post Office is now an institute but still looks convincing.  The white 'English' church still functions and looks just as pleasant here as they do in countless places in UK.  Activities on the Mall are entertaining.  A warning:  be careful with your ice-cream because the monkeys like them too.  They will sit arrogantly on the walk casually enjoying the last one they have stolen.  Quick access to the Mall is via a lift or along the pleasant Ridgeway."

Shimla has very narrow, steep roads and you will be dropped off at a main roadway, which is far below the tourist area commonly called “the Mall”.  You need to take two lifts (elevators) to get up/down to and from the mall.  You will see a ticket booth that sells lift tickets for 7 Rps.  Buy a ticket to go up and then (at the top) buy one to come back down.  The elevators are crowded; there will be a lift attendant who will take your ticket.  The first lift stops half-way, you get off and then get onto a second lift to get to the Mall level.

The Lower Bazaar sells common items (household items, cloth, material) that an Indian person might want. There are staircases all along the bazaars, which you can take up or down, as desired.  On the Mall level you can shop for pashminas, cashmere shawls, carvings, gloves, hats, saris and many other items.  There are cafes to eat at (I would highly recommend Café Sol) as well as several places where you can buy sodas, ice cream, popcorn etc.  

The Ridge is the top level where you will find St Michael’s church.  The church is free to visit (you can make a donation inside) and has beautiful stained glass windows and interesting plaques on the wall (in memory of people who died long ago).  There is a promenade area where people walk, sit or even take horse rides."

The HPTDC Runs a Lift to & from Lower Mall (Near Taxi Stand) to Upper Mall (Rs 8 One Way) which is a good way of saving oneself from tiring uphill climb especially on the way up. On The Upper Mall Road Near Scandal Point are Few Upmarket Restaurants ( Good Ambiance/Exorbitant Prices) and Some Good Bakeries. While on the Mall beware of the Touts of Tour Operators who will offer you all sorts of packages for Local as well as Kufri/Chail/Naldhera sightseeing and literally drag you to their shops and make you book/pay for a package before you know what happened. Best advice is sought from HPTDC Tourist Information Centre at The Scandal Point ( Beware of asking directions, instead of telling you where it is almost all shopkeepers/touts on road will start chatting you up to take their taxis/packages). All in All one can spend his time and money well eating/shopping on the Mall during his entire stay rather than spending it on Bogus sightseeing tours."

The Mall of Shimla","Not so long ago, when we were kids, Shimla was our annual pilgrimage! And Mall Road the deity ;) It was almost always teeming with leisure walkers, but it had a character not seen at any place else in India. It still retains that charisma. Though it is swarming, the sightseers maintain a certain politesse which I find extremely magical. It feels like a return to nostalgia, when you could spend your time doing the most diligent of all things: NOTHING!!

There are many a beliefs about the distance this stretch of road, but for me it starts from the Post Office and goes up to the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, or vice versa, depending on where I am staying- Grand or Combermere. An unhurried stroll to cover this breadth is the announcement I make to my mind and soul that finally it’s time to have a break! There is a reason for this: Driving from Delhi to Shimla is in itself as stressed out as living a 10AM-10PM life in the impossibly populous urban stink called Delhi.

All the major shops and departmental stores, restaurants and bakeries that make up this place are landmarks in their own rights. A few bigger ones are Diwan Chand Atma Ram Apparels, Alfa Restaurant, Indian Coffee House, Gainda Mal Hem Raj Departmental Store, Trishul Bakery, Baljees Sweetmeat, Café Sol…and a few others I am not naming so you can begin your nostalgic trip with me. 

The Christ Church at The Ridge can compete with Gateway of India as the most photographed monument in India. No tourist worth his phone camera can dare to announce a visit to Shimla on his Facebook wall without a flinty image of her on a horse with the church in the background, and Mahatma Gandhi’s watching with a benign smile from his podium.

The impressive roster of horses certifies that the kids of the family are excited to forego anything for a ride first. Check in the hotel and rush out to relish the Mall. That’s Shimla in succinct.

The Mall is an eternal fascination with me. Never once do I feel I am returning; each time is the first time, an untouched experience to treasure until the next visit!"

At the top end of the Mall is Scandal Point, a large open square with a view of the town- a favorite meeting for visitors and the local people. There is outstanding Christ Church, stands as the representative of the Shimla. We have enjoyed shopping, eating, sitting and roaming at The Mall. One who visit Shimla, must visit the Mall…"

It's the place to wander, to promenade and to soak up the atmosphere of the city. For many people it's the place to show off their wooly hats and thick coats as they enjoy what most of us Northern Europeans are far too used to - being cold. The shops? Well there's really nothing much to excite but if you look upwards, there are some super old buildings which I love to look at. In places it's extraordinarily cute - I love the teeny tiny 'sub-post office' which looks like something from a child's play set. The renovated Gaiety Theatre is an absolute star and is making the town hall next door look decidedly shabby.

If you're expecting something really special, you might be disappointed. This isn't about swanky shops and classy dining - it's just a place to plod slowly up and down, soaking up the atmosphere and getting used to the altitude."

By Indian standards, this upper part of Shimla has little traffic, is relatively clean, and surprisingly a ""smoke-free"" environment."

But then,the place has something about it which makes even this walk through the crowds fascinating.The old buildings exude a certain charm which adds to the experience.And if you're a foodie,you won't be disappointed as the whole road is dotted with eateries serving all kinds of cuisine.
   To summarise ,this is a place anyone going to Shimla will visit.When you go,go there with clear expectations.I don't think this is a place primarily for shopping(shopaholics please excuse )But if you really need something while you're in Shimla,this is the place to get it...and if you're someone with a penchant for taking a stroll enjoying people and the things around,this place is definitely for you...On  a personal note,i found it better than many of the so called attractions in Shimla"

Only if you are in mood to further shift into colder temperatures & have some fun in snow. Kalka is the nearest railhead from Shimla, KALKA SHATABDI express takes you from New Delhi to Kalka in almost 4.5 Hours. There are 2 shatabdis – one deaparting in the morning @007:40 hours, the other  @ 17:15 hours, both from New Delhi Railway station. There are good number of Volvo buses also plying between Delhi & Shimla. One can go ahead & get a bus booking done from Redbus.in or makemytrip.com. There are couple of other trains also running from Sarai Rohilla railway station to kalka but shatabdi  is the best train to travel in terms of time & conveniency. Once you reach Kalka, there are connecting Toy trains which can ferry you to Shimla in almost 5 hours. There are a host of toy trains , which gives sheer pleasure to children running past 103 tunnels, though the journey can be little boring for adults. If you happen to reach kalka at night by the evening shatabdi, you have toy trains like “Shivalik Deluxe ”, “Rail Motor”, “Himalayan Queen to take you to Shimla. If you reach kalka by the morning shatabdi, “himalyan queen” is the connecting toy train for the same. In winters, Northern Railways have big delays in train arrival & departure, so do not be shocked if Shatabdi departs 3-4 hours late & you miss the toy train. In that case, you get taxis from kalka to Shimla, small cars like Indica will charge you Rs.1600, bigger cars go upto Rs.3000. Generally, if you are in a big group, it is suggestible to hire a bigger car like a Qualis or innova. Shimla is a small city. It is the only city/Hill station in India which does not allow cars to come to the “Mall Road” – The most important market place & business centre of the city. Cars generally drop you near the bus stand. Even the railway station is nearest to the bus stand.  There are “lifts” available to carry you to the other parts of the city e.g the ridge. The city is divided into various elevations & for going into each part you can avail the lift facility. Normally, they charge Rs.100 to Indians for choosing the lift service. The other surprising part of Shimla one gets to see “Human Porters” who carry your luggage to the hotel. They also charge somewhere between Rs.100 –Rs.300 depending on the number of luggage & the distance that needs to be climbed up. Shimla has almost 300 hotels across various segments, Budget, Economy, Luxury. One can choose a hotel in Mall Road if he wants to live near the market place. In seasons, a deluxe room may cost you somewhere between Rs.2000- Rs.4000 in any of the hotels in Mall Road. If you do not want to shell out too much, you can choose hotels in the Ridge Area, Jakhoo temple road. A deluxe room for a night costs you Rs.800- Rs.1500 during the peak season. Hotel Wood land is a good choice. Doing an advance booking (a month ago) via makemytrip is suggestible .  Both YMCA & YWCA also offers cheap rooms at Rs.400 per night , but it is exclusively on first come first serve basis. One can divide Shimla trip into 2 parts. One complete day for local sight seeing, the other day to visit nearby areas like Kufri, Naldehra, Narkanda. Local Sightseeing attractions are Jakhoo temple (hanumanji temple), Shimla Church, Viceregal Lodge, Gaity Theatre, Institute of Advanced Studies, Mall Road. One can ask the hotel for local sight seeing tours. Or one can go to the “HIMACHAL PRADESH TOURISM’’ office located in Mall Road for booking local sight seeing tours. They charge you somewhere between Rs.50- Rs.100 per person in bus or tempo traveller. Kufri is located almost 21 kms from Shimla. Local tour operators/Hotels charge almost Rs.700 – Rs.1000 for half day Kufri, Faagu, Naldehra trip. Kufri is the nearest snow point to Shimla. On way to Kufri, you can see “Sanjauli” home to  Bollywood actress “Preity Zinta”. Enroute to Kufri, one can see “ Green valley”, home to various animals e.g snow leopard, bear, birds etc.  Snow patches starts on way to Kufri. Once you reach Kufri, one can hire “ponies” to go up to the Fagu valley. Please be careful negotiating on Pony Rates . As per the union, an average uphill & downhill journey taking you to Masu peak,  naag devta temple, Fun world & skiing point costs you Rs.380 per person. But due to increase in crowds, the horse riding exp. Is not good at all. The path uphill is a rocky terrain with one guy managing almost 4 horses. Once you reach Faagu valley, you can see China Border, The snow capped Himalayas . which is like a treat to the eyes. Do try out adventure sports like paragliding, rock climbing, skiing there. Also do not forget to taste “Maggi”, “Chane”  “Tea” & “ garam pakore” at Masu Peak. Children can get pictures clicked sitting on “Yaks” brought from Ladakh. One can also pose himself/herself wearing the local  costume “potu” available on Rent of Rs.100. Kufri, Faagu takes you half day & then you can be back at the hotel.

There are loads and loads of shops however it seemed that Shimla caters for mostly local tourists as 'normal' souvenirs are hard to come by. Also, we don't see any foreign tourist on the Mall Road! 

However, strolling along the few branches of the mall road, you will come across a road for cloths, kitchen utensils, clothings, woodwork etc. Coming from a tropical country and the unfortunately fact that I don't cook, I didn't buy anything except for a few keychains. But it is a pretty cool experience to see what the locals use for their daily lives. They do have some nice looking saree shops also. There are loads of restaurants and bakeries so eating here is not a problem. The servings are large so if you normally don't take 1.5 bowls of rice for your meal then I suggest that 2 persons to share one portion!  

Since it is a pedestrian road, the cars are usually parked much lower hence you will need to get onto a tourist lift to get onto Mall Road. We only had to take it once as we stayed in a hotel on the Mall Road, Hotel Willow Banks.

The lift is decades old and can fit about 7 people with luggage but it is a pretty tight squeeze. The drop off area to the lift is unfortunately filthy. You need to pay a nominal sum to get on the life, if I am not wrong INR8 and for senior citizens INR6. The first lift will take you to about 2/3 way up then you have to walk along a corridor to another lift  (and another queue) before you get to the Mall Road. 

The Mall Road goes up and down so if you are unfit or has knee or walking problem, this may not be a suitable place for you. But for people with toddlers, there are prams from rental along the road."

Until 1947 no Indians were allowed to walk on Mall Road except servants.  The Mall is most prettier than any other hill station.  The ancient buildings on its side gives the British era feeling which one will admire to the fullest.  Some of the buildings date back to 1905, 1890 etc.  The 'Nagar Palika' Bhavan is also very beautiful, though it is ill maintained by the Indians.  The English bureaucratic legacy is ill maintained by the Indians and it is very much evident here.  The 'Christ Church' is proudly situated at the corner of the Mall where the Sunday Prayers were held by the Viceroys of India. The Mall is at the most 1 Km long but the journey is of never lasting.  Every nook and corner is important in historical parlance.  The vehicles are not permitted on the Mall.  The scandal point is also very famous at the Mall.  The most attraction at the Mall are, The Christ church, Goofa and Ashiana Restaurent, BSNL building, Sagar Ratna Restaurent, Coffee House, HPTDC office, Nagar Palika Bhavan, Scandal Point, Gandhi Statue.  Spitting and smoking are not allowed on the Mall, ever caught with these bad habits, u will be fined very heavily.  Actually no one does mischievousness on the Mall due to its beauty."

The entire mall road looks like an open museum. The Ridge gives you a feeling of colonial India. The view of the beautiful Himalayan range and street food will keep you occupied for a few hours. You can also try horse ridding here, not very exciting though! There are not many cultural stores but you can still indulge in a little bit of shopping. Tibetan and Buddhist shops are mostly overpriced. The Mall is like a Connaught Place of New Delhi + better views!

Mostly flooded with tourists from nearby urban/semi-urban cities. My feeling is that there is not much one can do but then this depends on every individual! I'd like to appreciate the level of maintenance by local authorities. It is clearly visible that Himachal Government pays serious attention to tourism and it shows! Smoking is banned per government rule and there are plenty of sign boards to remind tourists about the same. Not just that, they have gone that extra step to provide trash bins at regular intervals.

There is a movie theatre too and just in case you have plans to catch a movie, avoid the night show! You can find almost everything you need, from food to alcohol. There are good bakery shops in the mall area and are usually crowded. Be careful with monkeys.

All in all, a good place for a day or two maximum! You like the place or you don’t, I leave that to you but do pay attention to basic travellers etiquette. Do not spoil the place!"

It was a long  long straight walk uphill towards Mall road..Shimla was the ""Summer Capital"" of the British Empire upto Independence in 1947 and hence their imprint was clearly visible on Mall road.Having visited and stayed in England which included London  i had a practical idea of British villages and City's. Shimla city in the Mall locality was an exact replica of a English town.There were numerous small shops on the Mall road,replica's of cute British cottages with colourful roofs.The entire straight narrow road has been preserved as it was prior to Independence in 1947.The only difference is the statues and busts of Indian freedom fighters and Prime Ministers installed along the ""Mall Road"", otherwise everything else is a replica of ""British India"" prior to Independence in 1947. A stroll along the Mall road at any time of the day or night is ideal for all ages  and sexes.The most modern  shops of World-Class branded goods are on the ""Mall road"" , a shoppers paradise.If you have nothing to do, just sit on one of the benches at ""Scandal Point"" and watch the crowd passing by and the monkeys indulging in 'Monkey Robbery"" and mischief.A word of caution is to be careful of your belongings  while at  the Mall as the macaque monkeys  in this city are very aggressive and bold , snatching   packets that resemble food products."

It is easily approachable from both ends of Shimla and hosts most of its cultural and heritage buildings. With a few steep climbs and falls, it also gives the meandering traveller a sense of adventure. Especially at night, the lights across Shimla Ridge appear like constellations across the sky, with the lit up Hanuman Statue atop Jakho hill like a Druva(pole/north) Star.
There are tasty treats for discerning bites from confectionaries, bakeries and restaurants along the Mall. All leading stores are positioned along the Mall, making it a horizontal version of our sky scraper Super Markets in cities, with brands like Rebok, Nike,Samsung, Nikon etc having their own retail outlets.
The Mall begins with an ornate Traffic Point with Statues of National leaders, then splits into two, and rejoins around the Park for Women and Children. Starting from Kali Bari Temple to the path leading to Jakho Temple, with the Gaiety Theatre, The Town Hall, Scandal Point, the Shimla Church situated in-between it makes for a wonderful evening of exploration and sightseeing. The Mall widens to its maximum girth under the Gandhi Statue with a pavilion situated overhead as a vantage point from where perhaps leaders/speakers address crowds thronged below. There is a lift system to convey persons from the lower ridge to the Mall which is located near the Town Hall.
It is a wonderful paradise for a stroll and a magnet of Shimla as a tourist attraction. You must take a stroll along it each night you spend in Shimla!"

The Mall has its own character which makes it such a unique destination whenever people come down to Shimla. There are many diverse shops and we were quite taken in by the place to the point that we spent much of our 3 days that we were in Shimla strolling up and down the Mall road.

It is not a very long 'street' but the views of the valley are awesome. The Mall starts where Lakkar Bazaar (with lots of small shops selling wooden curious; we picked up a wooden croc, and other sundry stuff) ends. There are multiple entries/exits to the Mall and the uphill walk to it can be stressful if you are the usual big-city dweller! There is a 'lift' (one-way ticket costs Rs 10) available, but despite that you will need to do some walking.

The peaceful walk down The Mall, with colonial era quaint buildings on one side and the valley on another is rather pleasant; you will like it. A few steps down from the Mall there are restaurants and a couple of watering holes.

By the way, from the Mall you can see the peak of the renowned Jakhu Temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman."

Located on the way to Lakkar Bazaar, this strip of road has some fantastic view points of Scandal Point, Jakku temple Hanuman statue towering over the trees visible from the Mall road.

There is a statue commemorating Dr. Y.S.Paramar - founder of Himachal and a small garden. Another statue is that of Lala LajpatRai which has a nice small fountain. Another place to sit around and laze is near Indira Gandhi Statue.

No automobiles are allowed in this stretch which gives the freedom to walk, laze around, sip a nice cup of coffee / pastry/ softy from the multiude of shops nearby and just take in the sights.We had some Honey Tea and Honey Ice Cream at HoneyHut . There are lot of benches all along to take rest but there are equal number of footfalls 

 The shops here and on Lakkar Bazaar offer a variety of products colorful joothis, scarves, shawls etc . There are multiple level steps leading from the Mall to the Bazaars down and the lift. Since there are no vehicle movement, we can move safely and there is a police station also nearby.   

 Looking at the colors, breathing in the clean air, lazing around the Mall Road rest assured will leave you with a happy feeling."

The lower street or mall is where the locals shop, full of bustle and colour with hundreds of stalls selling everything you can think of. The stall holders do not hassle you which is normally endemic in India, and are very patient and friendly. You will probably get asked if they can take a photo of you with their children. You are the attraction here!
The upper mall is more upmarket with many designer names and better quality jewelery shops.
Local wine and spirit shops sell the local rum, ""Old Monk"", and brandy, ""Honey Bee"", and half bottles of each cost less than £2 equivalent!
One cafe/shop is a must stop on this level, ""The Honey Pot"", where you can enjoy great coffee, hot chocolate and herbal tea with a chocolate brownie to die for. The cafe not only sells the herbal tea in caddies and pots of the local honey, but also little pots of honey based skin preparations such as eye balm and anti-ageing cream for around 60p equivalent a pot! Brilliant value, and they make great stocking fillers along with the usual socks, scarves, pashminas etc."

Well, in theory it's a pedestrian mall; maybe some of the drivers honking madly up at the top just missed the signs.
I don't think I'd want to stay in a hotel that's right smack on Mall Road, but I like staying close enough to walk over to, down, and up it. The road is broad enough to handle a fairly large number of people (during my latest visit there was a dress rehearsal for the Republic Day parade, and people kept right on shopping) although it can get a bit crowded on weekends. If you need a cardio workout, you can get it on the Mall Road. If you don't, you can walk down to the bottom and, for just 10 rupees, take the lift (actually, 2 separate elevator rides) most of the way back up.
Mall Road stores offer a vast array of wool items: scarves, mufflers, pashminas, etc. Yak wool is warm, cashmere is luxurious.. If you enjoy haggling, you'll have plenty of opportunities. If that doesn't appeal to you, there are a couple of places with nice quality goods where the price is what it is - although it never hurts to ask for a quantity discount. Shehzadi, near the top of the lift, has some lovely articles of clothing. The Himachal Emporium sells local handicrafts at fair trade prices, so you can shop with a clear conscience. One of the ubiquitous Himachali caps would be an attractive and unusual souvenir.
Rudyard Kipling once lived nearby, in a house called Northbank. Good luck finding it."

On the way from Kandaghat to Mashobra, we visited Shimla via the lift. Nice concept. You go up two fllors via two different lifts. We first went down the local road - very crowded and like a village market. The Mall was better, and we had a look at the Town Hall and there was a book fair in the adjacent building. Mainly local publishers. We had an Italian ice-cream and visited a shawl emporium. Otherwise there are cheap Shimla shawls and suits that were not very nice. Can't make out whether it is local stuff or Ludhiana. Our next trip was on a Sunday when the shops were closed. We visited Christ Church and that was nice with stained glass windows. It was not very crowded as we had been warned, but was nothing spectacular. On Sunday we also visited the Lakkad Bazaar, but here too we could not buy anything, as you get much better stuff at Janpath. Overall a disappointment. Only the HPMC juices are a delight."

The Mall is the place to be in Shimla. The view, the architecture of the adjacent buildings, the horse rides, the parks and the flea market all add to the intricate appeal of this place. With a little more planning and perhaps a little less crowd on the streets this will be a great place to have evening walks. The Lift from the base to the top of the mall is a real feat and thanks to the people who envisaged this. Enterprising locals also offer you prams rented by the hour to carry your kids (believe me without this it would be quite a drag to carry kids to the top). With Macdonalds and KFC around the corner the old charm is a little lost but still the mall in the evening, overlooking the whole valley is the sight to behold!"

It pretty much defines Shimla, perhaps erroneously so. But you cannot separate The Mall from Shimla. The Mall is a stretch of two-three parallel roads at varying altitudes that serve as open markets. You can shop in the innumberable shops here or eat at one of the many cafes/ restaurants. You can also dress up in the local attire and get yourselves clicked. A number of structures date back to the British times. At the top, called the ridge, are lookout points, the Christ Church, and a number of government offices. While visiting during monsoon, we seemed to be walking amongst clouds. Having said this, one visit to The Mall is sufficient, unless you wish to return to eat."

TIps

1.0) Do NOT try any of the food here! unless you have already had your spell of 'Delhi belly' before reaching here. 
2.0) This is not loop or circular walk, do not go too far as you will have to probably turn back and if you go over the ridge downhill, you will have to walk uphill again. My advise, turn back from the ridge to where you came from.
3.0) If you are going to use the lift, get ready for a tight fit, it's the smallest of lifts you could get, you will be squashed against the locals and also be charged for it."

As soon as you enetr the road, a number of agents would pester you for trip to nearby places. Its kind of irritating.There are branded showrooms along. One can find booking counter for volvo and other buses for various places. One park is there also along one of the sides which has some entrance fee. But it is so small that one can see from the road only. Some snack shops are also there and a restaurant and bar run by HP tourism is alo there. The church is the main highlight. Some benches are also put alongside facing the valley. One can get some bful views from there. One road from the church goes towards Ritz cinema and another towards the lakkar bazaar. The things are overly priced in most of the shops but as you walk farther away one can buy wood articles at comparatively cheaper prices. 
Shimla itself does not have much to roam about. The trip is enough for a weekend."

It was a refreshing drive with well laid down roads, green valleys and easy ghats. A 3-4 hour ride, a 5 minute lift and we were at Shimla’s Mall Road. The Mall Road is dotted by the some places one should visit without fail. I enjoyed clicking a photo at Scandal Point, spending time in the Ritz Church and the british colonial old stone buildings. I loved the Gaiety Theatre too. Paid an extra 25 rs to take my camera inside and shot a photo which my folks liked back home (ultimate recognition for me). I think you should too. And excellent place to capture architecture in low light conditions. I enjoyed Shimla. There are stands put up opposite the church where people chat up or just read the newspaper. With vehicular traffic banned, the air is pure. Benches line up either side of the Mall Road and you can spend a lot of time just sitting there with your loved ones. A slow pace of life coupled by a pure atmosphere is what you need at the beginning of a vacation.  We moved into Toshali Royal View that night. We were seven of us and we had booked 3 rooms. And there was a surprise waiting for us, the hotel management was kind to give us the 3 rooms (with respective bathtubs and shitplace) which were inter-connected. Also equipped  with a welcome drink, fruits and cookies. The view from our balconies was a bonus. Mountains and valleys dressed in thick deodhar trees."

Lower bazaar is as crowded and lively as any other market in Indian cities.

Restaurants are disappointing meaning not many. Lakkar bazaar is disappointing with not much local crafts, all the shops have exactly the same stuff.

Horse ride is good and cheap ( 50 Rs for 1, 70 for 2), good fun for kids.

My advice for first timers, walk from the mall to IIAS ( 2.5 KM one way, and you will pretty much see everything there is to see in this area).

On mall road at ridge ( circular area) you can click photos in himachal pradesh traditional dresses. They simply look awesome and charge rs 60 per photo and is delivered in 10 min. After ridge, you can visit the christ church. At ridge,  there is Indira Gandhiji's statue. On this road there are many hotels, travel services available.  You can buy beautiful pashmina shawls, jackets, woolen sweaters and traditional hp men's cap. You can also visit "" The coffee shop"" an awesome restaurant where you get nice coffee and south and north Indian snacks.  Avoid taking hotel on top of mall road,  it is very tedious to walk.

I particularly enjoyed taking the longest elevator ride of my life to get up there! For around 20 rupees, it was actually quite short, around 2 minutes and suddenly you were up at the top instead of taking stairs.

There are lots of bakeries and stalls to buy food, lovely bookstores and a few monuments and older building used for governmental purposes and a church that is very beautiful. I also enjoyed the 'Females only' park for women and children.

It was a lovely walk, and exceptionally clean as Shimla is a smoking free city and fines are paid for littering - I love that these rules are implemented! The mall was one of the most quaint, relaxing and picturesque areas I was fortunate enough to spend the day roaming."

There does seem to be a real effort here to make the place reasonable for visitors and security (local/ tourist ?) police are evident in the area which is reassuring. Do not stay on the top street however ,drop off to the lower narrower streets full of life, people and goods of all sorts and you will really enjoy it. Although my friend and I seemed to be the only European people wandering around there was no hassle whatsoever and the locals seemed friendly and very helpful but did not pressure us to buy anything. You could actually look at things without buying, unusual.
A great experience which I would recommend and the local council or equivalent should be praised for the efforts they have obviously made."

Mall Road is the main street in Shimla, the capital city of Himachal Pradesh, India. Constructed during British colonial rule, the Mall road is located a level below the ridge. The offices of municipal corporation, fire service, and police headquarters are located here. Automobiles, except emergency vehicles are not allowed on this road. For this reason, the locals — and tourists — are often found strolling on this road in the evenings.

Mall road has a number of showrooms, department stores, shops, restaurants and cafes. A Himachal emporium that offers handicraft products of Himachal Pradesh like locally designed woollen cloths, branded cloths, pottery items, and jewellery is also located here.There are at least three books shops including one that sells old books."

Main attraction to Shimla is the Ridge and Mall road. The place is best when the sun begin to set and the night begins to fall. If you are lucky enough to experience the drizzling rain at that time, i would say that your trip to the Mall Road of Shimla is complete. The Mall Road is packed with the showrooms and market, be it the handmade stuff or something fancy, you will not be disappointed. There everything for everybody from a casual shopper to the ""Professional Shopper"" :p. A lot of options for shopping and at the other end of the Road you can enjoy the scenic beauty of the Mountains . Also near the Ridge you can find a long row of little shops where a lot of different stuff is sold. And if you have spare time left on you trip to Shimla I would recommend to visit Kufri  which is around 35 Kilometers from Shimla.. It will be an amazing experience to visit Shimla If you're fascinated by nature as well as you're shopping freak, a rare combination :D.."

Shimla was the summer capital of the British Empire and the mall road clearly shows why it was so. Vehicles are not allowed so the place is unpolluted ,filled with the freshness of the hills. The place is truly magical and romantic especially during the night time. I prefer to come during early mornings and roam around till the sunset. The wind energises your soul. What is truly fascinating about Shimla is the weather. Its really unpredictable. It may be a bright day during the morning but may begin to rain by the noon and even snow during the evening in the winter months. such fluctuations can be experienced twice or thrice in a day. It seems like the weather is having a mood swing! My favourite place here is the Ridge. All the major food courts are located on the mall road. You can also visit the nearby temples like Jakhu Temple. If you are not keen on walking,  you can take a cab to the jakhu temple. If you are fond of walking than you can also take the forest road which is also known as the lovers lane! Many ghost stories are also related to this road."

It is a great place to hang out with your family and friends. To reach the mall first you need to buy tickets for the 2 lifts which will take you there. The mall is divided in 3 levels. The lower level contains the local shops with your veggies and fruit markets – again very congested. The middle level contains branded show rooms. The upper level contains the famous sight-seeing points of Shimla. It also has the famous wooden market or the lakkad bazaar. 

We started for the upper level to cover the famous spots of Shimla – the church and the scandal point. From a distance we spotted the church. Since both the attractions are close by you can see many people thronging the area and sitting on the many wooden benches provided by the municipal authorities. 

After this we went to the scandal point. It is said that a local boy eloped with a British governor’s daughter from this very point and hence it got the name. The view from this point is simply amazing.

Next we went to the very famous lakkad bazaar. No plastics are allowed here which is a thumbs up!! Since Shimla is full of pine and deodar trees you can find loads of wooden artifacts here. So if you are planning to buy souvenirs from this place then wooden handicrafts are the best bet."

Weird and very enjoyable after the inevitable stresses of day today travel in India."

Built by the British during the colonial rule in India, the Mall Road was constructed keeping in mind the traffic on this route. Entry of vehicles was banned though cycle rickshaws were allowed. It has been built in a very strategic and planned way.

The Mall is situated in the main street of Shimla. All colonial structures are located on the Mall Road. The Mall Road also has all major hotels, restaurants and recreation centers of Shimla. The Mall road is full of shops that sell woolen clothes, branded clothes, handicraft items, pottery items, jewellery, books, etc. The Mall Road is also famous for its wooden furniture shops that sell exquisite wooden articles, which look like antiques.

The Mall Road has many famous restaurants that specialize in not just local cuisines but also delicacies from nearby places. Since there are no vehicles allowed in the Mall, you don't quite have to worry about watching out for the traffic. While purchasing locally made goods, make sure you do some bargaining. Ideally, you should make sure that you bargain till at 30% of the amount quoted by the shopkeepers. The whole area is fun to loiter around in and you wont even know when time flies by."

there are a lot of monkeys - so when u r walking around with snacks / ice cream - be a little careful. 

there is krishna bakery at the mall road - try Kurkis from them.. and chicken momos..

there is a small flea market sometimes that takes place behind the church - that was a fun find.. 

if u r looking for adventure - go watch a movie at Ritz cinema hall behind the Shimla Church :)

if the weather permits, i could sit here an entire day, sip coffee from ccd / barista, buy a magazine, observe the passers by and tourists and eat momos and candy floss.. 

will see u soon for the 300th time, shimla mall :)"

But both the upper and down bazars are not good","The KFC and Dominos are both just few meters from top lift exit to bazar. We could shop very little in Shimla because I believe in comparison to Manali, Dharamshala and Masauri the market was not good for shoping and the shop keepers are not very good to tourists. I found nothing special or good for tourist. I came back all the way from upper bazar to lower bazar but finally decided to have some chicken from KFC. Unfortunately I tried the new Chizza or someting new like that. It was like ""basi Besa-pakoda"" that I did not liked then tried some regular chicken and that was also sub standard. Then I tried Dominos and finally I found something up to the mark."

-----------------

>> Number of shopping options-There are 3 levels of shopping.One level has vegetable and fruits.Another has clothing,winter wear,shoes etc.Third one has Town handicrafts,heritage items etc

>> Variety of restaurants-You can have a range of eating options.Indian,Chinese,Italian,Mexican,American.You have street options,dhaba style food and dine in options across all levels.You just have to check what your taste buds are looking for and select an option

>> Wonderful to see multiple cultures and people across India and may be world at a place and if you are a avid observer you can appreciate the colours and colonial look of the mall road

>> Sunset View from Mall Road is exceptional.But if you are in winter make sure you have enough clothing as it really gets cold after sunset.Apart from sunset you can enjoy various views of the Shimla City and hills around it.

 What can improve
-------------------------

>> More lifts or more modes of transport to go to mall road.It is difficult for aged people to climb uphill or slope.Also better service of existing lifts."

It has the likes of Cafe Coffee Day, KFC, Pizza Hut abound on the once quiet road and is full of action, on the single stretch of road, which must be a kilometer long. From clothing to woolens, shoes, fashion wear, wines, etc you get all the stuff right here. There is a two level twin seven member capacity lift to take you to the Mall road which is at a height and in the season there is a huge queue to handle. Ticket for the lift is Rs.10 per person and there's a discount for senior citizens.
I shopped for the following and got really good deals on:
1) Fruit Wines Rs 200 per bottle- A fully dedicated shop for Himachali fruit wine
2) Kashmiri colourful dress material Rs. 300- Just upon entering the Mall road, there is a shop on the left hand side after CCD which has a basement. They are very reasonable and have quality items. There is a female attendant who was very warm at serving us even at 8:30 in the night.
3) Sweaters- Get fashion woollen wear for as less as Rs. 400- 500 in vibrant colours in a shop at the fag end of Mall road only for Woollens, they also have excellent leather jackets (Negi, i think)
4) Woollen socks & caps- We good quality woollen socks for Rs. 130 and caps for Rs. 150. They kept us warm all through to Manali.
5) Shoes are expensive - Better buy only if in dire need. Manali has better, imported Nepalese fashion footwear.
We visited Mall road just to roam around and had no intention of shopping, but ended up splurging. After all, we were on vacation!
In comparison to the Manali mall road, the Shimla mall road is smaller. There is more variety on Manali Mall road and its bye lanes. Its all about where your need arises and how much you are willing to pay!"

Once you reach there you will feel good. The mall road is on the left on the exit to the elevator and the shops are really good for shopping. The cultural department of HP is also situated on the Mall Road which the people should see."

Full on crowd on road, mall road,  ridge, temple

First Suggestion is to book your hotel accommodation before visit Shimla. 

Try to reach Shimla in morning before 12pm so that you wont find difficulty to get car parking.

You can reach Mall road via walking and Lift option.  Lift is famous place in Shimla.  The charge of lift is 10rs. For adult and 5 rs. For children till 3yrs.

Better get a ticket and stand in a queue to go via the lift. 

If you want to do shopping in mall road its not worth as you can find most of the things in yiur local market. 

Better click photos and go for the ridge upside. 

Read my feedback for ridge also.

Thank You"

I had heard a lot about the place hence had to visit more like a check on the to do list. Never stayed in Shimla as I had heard how commercialised and crowded this destination was. I had also heard about the crazy ques for the lifts which which takes one up an down to the mall road....all came to be true. on a week day we had to wait for over 15 minutes to get the lift both ways. The worst part is one has to first rush to the counter to get the tickets and they sell only one way even if you planning to return the same day down. Lift one takes you to a landing and one has to walk a 100 meter to get to other which lands on to the Mall and the Madness.

The moment you step out you are flooded with more people, shops and chaos.

What's your agenda is what I ask?

If you here to shop for local stuff then its great place for woollens and souvenirs at great prices. Rest all is high priced or stuff which is available readily in most cities as same price. The place is dotted with multiple food joints - local and brands. The mall itself is divided further into upper and lower.

Since our agenda was a tick thats what we did and ran back to peaceful haven at Kandaghat.

I believe there are a few tourist spots but we were not too keen. 

Do visit but keep your Agenda clear.

Avoid Avoid Avoid weekends I believe the que is never ending for the lifts and Mall road is jam packed"

Do not come here in season or during long weekends. The mall is best enjoyed when the crowd is less. Lot of options for window shopping as well as eating. Take your snacks and go sit next to the elevated seats on the left side of the Church / below the LCD board. You can kill hours here. On a good clear  day, you can also see the Himalayan peaks.

Shimla used to be the summer capital of pre-independence India, and the buildings on the Mall and around are a testimony to it. Shops here are very expensive, as you can buy the same stuff for half the price a few meters down the Mall, in the local market.

A good place to roam around, to hang out with family and to take pictures to show the glory of Shimla."

It is also a shopping market where you will probably can see all the big brand showrooms. Good food joints everywhere and the ridge, christ Church, lower bazar and lakkar bazar are just near by. The best time to be at the place is any evening but a Saturday evening is always crowded. A must place to visit."

Visited it several times with family and friends. But a visit was long overdue. The sudden desire of my son who was a kid when we visited Shimla last time, gave the desire to  visit Shimla a sudden impetus  and we promptly reached Shimla. 
As we reached there on a Friday, I was looking to have my Friday prayers at Shimla. Luckily we reached there in time and the first thing I did was to reach for the Jama Masjid. After the prayers were over, we promptly retreated to hotel as we were very tiredbut we were again ready to  go to the mall Road, our favourite haunt in the evening after a great nap in between.As we were carried by the lifts installed in  the vicinity of our hotel, we were delighted to reach the mall Road on the effects hand side of the Oberoi Charles ; we were happy to see the usual razmatazz despite this being off season. The usual sight of love birds walking hand in hand or making an occasional love gesture is a hallmark of the place and was to behold at umpteenth spots. 
We had decided to get into Nalini for the dinner but were  quite disappointed  this time as neither the ambience was good nor the food quite as tasty as we found it years ago.
It was pretty cold as the night progressed. Left  the place at 10 when it became chilling.
Mall Road is still the cleanest area in Shimla despite dirt and garbage in other areas.
Would like to go back to the  mall with more family members in future.😊"

You may not be under CCTV surveillance but they are watching you minutely. The moment you leave anything on a bench for clicking a snap or something, the monkey brigade is there to take away your belongings. It is better to find out a hotel either near mall or in Cart Road from where you can access mall through tourism department's lift easily. Most of the attraction points in Shima are in and around mall. You may cover places like Scandal Point, Christ Church, GPO or hotel Grand just by walking through the mall. Shimal Kalibari is also just 15 minutes walk from Mall. But yes, it was not very easy to climb to mall from my hotel near Auckland tunnel, though the distance was small. It is better to avoid Monday in Shimla as most of the places including Indian Institute of Advanced Studies are closed on Mondays.  While commuting to Chandigarh/ Kalka, please note that buses are not as frequent as popularly said. Moreover the ISBT is quite far from the main city of Shimla. But finally end October weather is lovely with clear sky and pleasant walk. There are lot of eateries, bars, restaurants and attractive bakeries around the mall. It is a pleasant walk in the city for one evening and one morning but if you stay longer, may be you need to travel to places like Kufri as there is not much to see in Shimla. One more good point about Mall in Shimla is it does not allow any vehicle; hence there is no ham in careless walking as well. People in Shimla are quite friendly and hospitality in the hotels is worth mentioning. It will be great to visit Shimla again soon, may be during snowfall in December!"

Shimla is situated on hills and most hotels are accessible only by steps. Cars need to be parked at a distance. Also, vehicles not allowed on mall road. You got to hire a porter to carry your bags. So it is important to choose a hotel where you can take the car to the front gate. 2. the mall road is the happening place of Shimla, It's essential part of Shimla life. So choosing a hotel on or close by mall road; is also important. 3. Mall road also has many restaurants and road side eateries. So its best to stay close by, or else the only option you have is the food offered by your hotel. That seems to restrictive. 4.Parking is a big problem in Shimla and be sure to choose a hotel which has enough parking of its own. 5. Remember to close your windows all the time, monkeys roam around looking for food and fruits and try to enter the hotel rooms if the windows are open.

You can see the national flag flying high up on the hill, this is a good place to roam around and to watch the sun set. This place is also accessible from mall road. There is a church near by and if you look up to the left of the church, you see a big statue of Hanumanji on the top of the hill. This is the well known Jakhu temple. When you get down from the other side from this place,[opposite of mall road] you go through a tiny aisle, Its the Tibetan market. Here, you get jackets, sweaters, caps etc at reasonable price.

New Shimla & mall road etc is up on the hill and Chhota Shimla is down the hill. Usually do not go for hotel in Chhota Shimla, it will be far away from mall road."

This was our first trip to Shimla. We went by road from Chandigarh to Shimla and it took almost four hours to drive. Most of the road was good except for some patches in between and road widening project in some places.

Shimla during winters is best time to visit as you can get good hotel deals , no over crowded markets / roads and one gets all the time.

Shimla is a historic city and when you walk down the Mall Road , you go back in history. British era buildings , post office , hotels , libraries , tower , etc. If you are lucky you can also get a glimpse of clear Himalaya.

One must try Indian delicious street food like Tikki , Samosa's , Jalebi in hot milk glass , fresh apple juices and so on."

There are excellent vantage points for taking photos from this 2200 metre high mountain. The area is steeped in history and you can see the remains of the English architecture in some of the buildings.
There are lots of good restaurants and cafe that will cater for all diets. It is cheaper to eat out here that hotels the same for drinking. Plenty of shopping for textiles  and souvenirs but you need to bargain so know what you want and what the going price is before you get down to the any big purchases.
The Mall area is pedestrians only except for ambulances. Be also aware it is very hilly with steps and you are 2200 meters up so the air is thin so go steady. You can get low cloud and this can make it cool especially early in the morning or late in the evening.
But well worth the journey and an experience."

A vehicle free zone, people walk up and down, window shopping, tucking into the food at the restaurants, going for pony rides, or just lazing around, or soaking up the sun when it is cool, taking selfies by the large national flag installed there or with whatever background catches their fancy. In the olden times there would be hand drawn carts for the elderly, nowadays one can find prams for kids and wheel chairs for those who wish that convenience, both with a handler, for a fee of course..

There are plenty of eating options, from snacks to proper meals and bars. During the tourist season these are pretty jam packed.

One problem is that of monkeys, if provoked they can get aggressive.

ATMs are a bit hard to find, but towards the DC Office, that is a little way down from Scandal Point, there are a few of them.

To get to the Mall there is 2 stage elevator from Cart Road. Tickets are priced at 10 rupees for adults and 7 for senior citizen. There is a pretty large car park (which is being expanded) near the Elevator. Queues here can be long, and the wait time can go up to 15 minutes or more. If you are well connected, you can get a car pass to get your car up to the DC Office, but parking here is pretty much impossible to find."

We visited Mall on 9 and 10 Jun 2017. While 9th was a rainy day, 10th was completely sunny. Both days were great experience for us, especially the Ridge and Surrounding area in a periphery of 500 m from The Ridge. It is the most clean, safe and happening area there. One can enjoy decent views from the Ridge of surrounding mountains and as well enjoy many great food options. We enjoyed food at Wake n Bake, Embassy (for Ice cream), Sita Ram (Lakkar bazar) Luchi n Cholae. 

A word of caution. Monkeys are a nuisance in Shimla. Do not opt for take away food and do not have it while strolling on the Mall. Monkeys can come from anywhere. Though, after sunset, monkeys are not seen and it is safer.

Since vehicles are completely banned on the Mall, opt for a hotel that is nearby, especially if you are not travelling in your own vehicle.

At last, I would say, the Mall exceeded my expectations in all respects.  No vehicles, safe for children running around, neat n clean, very well maintained - perfect roads, perfect street lighting"

There are shops all along the road selling different kinda stuffs (bargain as much as possible, if interested in buying a thing or two). From the main spot you'll be getting the mesmerizing view of the valley. ❤❤❤
You'll be able to see the ice capped ranges of mountains 🗻 (if the sky is clear).

The Mall, which is the main commercial street of this hill station town, is no exception, with wooden shop and restaurant facades decorated in bright colours, a few attractive stone buildings left over from colonial times and a wide pedestrian thoroughfare. 
I was there in December and was lucky enough to enjoy two days of brilliant sunshine. Unlike other travellers who have left reviews here, I did not find the street overcrowded. Lively, certainly, but not uncomfortably so. Possibly this was due to the time of year.
The street is well provided for with useful shops, cafes and restaurants and is, of course, conveniently close to most of Shimla's other attractions.
If you're in Shimla, you should see it and, frankly you'd be hard pressed not to pass through it at some point anyway!"

Constructed during British colonial rule, the Mall road is located a level below the ridge. The offices of municipal corporation, fire service, and police headquarters are located here. Automobiles, except emergency vehicles are not allowed on this road. For this reason, locals and tourists are often found strolling on this road in the evenings.

Mall road has a number of showrooms, department stores, shops, restaurants and cafes. A Himachal emporium that offers handicraft products of Himachal Pradesh like locally designed woolen clothes, branded clothes, pottery items, wooden products, and jewellery is also located here.

Scandal point is where the Mall road joins Ridge road on the west side. The name arose from the commotion caused by the supposed elopement of a British lady with an Indian Maharaja. The story goes that the Maharaja of Patiala had eloped with the daughter of the British Viceroy. This had led to the Maharaja being banished from entering Shimla by the British authorities. He countered the move by setting himself a new summer capital – now famous hill resort of Chail, 45 km from Shimla.

The most prominent feature of the point today is a statue of the Indian freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai (no relation to the scandal). Next to Scandal Point is the General Post Office, Shimla.

Gaiety Theater, located on the Mall, was opened on 30 May 1887. Many popular film personalities have performed on its stage.
Today, the Gaiety is primarily known for its social club. Schools in Shimla use this theater for performing arts.[3] The theater has been renovated with the original structure untouched to keep its heritage preserved while making it more attractive.

Kali Bari Temple
The temple was built in 1845. It is dedicated to the goddess Kali. It is believed that in an ancient temple of Shimla, the goddess Kali existed, near Jakhoo. In the temple a wooden image is worshiped locally.[5]

Town Hall
The recently renovated Municipal Corporation building of Shimla adds to the surrounding architecture, reminiscent of the pre-independence era. The building is preserved in its original form. The large steps and the entrance to this building are a common site for pictures depicting the Mall at Shimla. More than 5 crore rupees were spent in renovating this colonial architectural marvel."

Ever since I was a child, I had been hearing about the magic of The Mall in Shimla from people who had visited the hill station. Shopping for little mementos is an essential part of any holiday! Keeping that in mind I headed towards The Mall during a recent visit to Shimla. I was fascinated by the shops, the cobbled street and the different levels that constitute The Mall. This is primarily a pedestrian zone where the various levels are connected intermittently by fairly steep, stone steps. It being the Easter weekend, the area was milling with tourists. Despite that, quite a few of the shops, some of them institutions in themselves, were empty, the salespersons gazing out onto the road hoping to make a sale. There are a number of restaurants along the road catering to all sorts of tastes. We had gone to Devicos, which was okay. But I really loved Cafe Sol which is a part of Hotel Combermere. Cafe Sol offers Continental food, and their speciality are the pastries, pasta and burgers. We wanted to buy some locally produced jams and chutneys and were directed to Gendamull Hemraj because they have an amazing assortment on their shelves. Benches and shelters have been provided all along The Mall for people to take a rest when they get tired of walking. One gets a stunning view of Shimla from various points along the Mall. The best way to come up to the Mall is by the public lift which charges 10 rupees per person (less for senior citizens). Getting to the Mall is done in two stages, with a short walk between the two levels of the lifts.
Being fond of walking we walked from the Viceregal Lodge to The Mall .... a distance of almost 5 kilometres ... though in hindsight we realised our folly! However, although senior citizens had better not attempt this walk, younger people should try it because not only is it a scenic walk, one also passes historically important buildings along the way. We passed Hotel Cecil, which is believed to be the first hotel that the Oberoi family built, and a place that was frequented by many eminent persons in India's history. 
The Viceregal Lodge now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Out of the hundred plus rooms inside the building, only four are open for public viewing. The initial draft that decided the fate of India in 1947 is believed to have been drawn up inside this building. The grounds are beautifully maintained and well worth a visit.
Chail, where the erstwhile Maharaja of Patiala built a palace is about 55 kilometres away from Shimla. This palace has now been turned into a hotel. Driving to Chail one passes Kufri and Kandaghat. Kufri is famed as a ski resort but we didn't see any snow at this time of the year. Chail boasts of having the highest cricket field in the world. However, since this has now passed into military occupation, civilians are not allowed access to this area.
For those who are religiously inclined, the small Kali Temple above the Mall is a must visit. The Christ Church, believed to be the second oldest church in northern India, is also a place worth a visit. 
Tourists coming to Shimla should plan their travel in such a way that they can make a part of the trip, either way, on the Toy Train. It is really an unforgettable experience! Travelling by train is a leisurely activity but one gets to see the enchanting beauty of the mountainside from really close quarters, something that travelling by car deprives you of. 
One aspect of life in Shimla struck me as being exceptional. First of all, I found the local people to be extremely courteous and patient. Hailing from a metropolitan city I have grown used to people being impatient and uncompromising. Meeting the average Himachali person was an eye opener! The other thing that impressed me was the smartness and efficiency of the Police force, a lot of them women. All over the country people talk about equal opportunities for women, but Himachal Pradesh has acted on this pledge and it was a pleasure to see these women working shoulder to shoulder with the men!"

The 'Mall' is like a small town high street with an odd monkey. If you are going to India to see India and are thinking of travelling to Shimla especially then do your research carefully. The last 70 miles or so takes 4 hours and the town itself is just a former colonial town.

Such places are hard to find within India, and thus it floors Indians--but for the world traveller, it is not that big of a deal.
  At the same time, many Indians are in fact disappointed by the Mall because they hear a lot about it before visiting it--and are shocked to find that it is just a long road with a bunch of shops and eateries on either side!
  Lately the government has spent a lot of money to ""beautify"" the Mall--with moderate results.  You now find more benches in the streets on which tourists could sit and look at the flow of people in the road, monkeys, some greenery, and the stone walls.  But the civil government has a very conservative mindset; so, they won't let you have any real fun--such as dance or parties.  The police especially harasses young women if they loiter about after 11 PM; and the police does the same to young Indian couples.
  Again, you cannot expect much from the authorities to protect your right to individual liberties and entertainment.
  There is no dance hall around the Mall that you could authentically enjoy at all.  The DJs, as few as they are, are 5th rate; people who work at the bars or at probably the only dance bar are very narrow-minded and lack exposure.  The business establishments are focused entirely on how much money they could make.
  So, the only real significance of the Mall is that it is the only space in Shimla where you could see hordes of people passing through, buying stuff, and desperately looking to have fun but in fact failing to find it.
  No, you can't tell that to the locals--as they don't like The Mall to be assessed at all; they assume it is the ultimate tourism.  Well, it is far from that."

Constructed during British colonial rule, the Mall road is located a level below the ridge. The offices of municipal corporation, fire service, and police headquarters are located here. Automobiles, except emergency vehicles are not allowed on this road.

The Mall Road is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Shimla that has many hotels, restaurants, clubs, bars, banks, shops, offices, post offices, and tourist offices. People can walk up and down the Mall road slowly and enjoy the scenic views of the nature. A lot of people gather at the Ridge and Scandal point on Mall road to meet and talk with friends, see the views of the Himalayan range and to do some shopping. The Mall road is connected to the Ridge at the Scandal point, where a statue of the nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai has been erected.

If you have half a day or even a full day ,you can spend that at the Mall road and you will not feel bored, as there are so many people , so much activity. As for shopping , be weary , as it's very expensive compared to what items should cost, so you have to negotiate ."

Its really nice. I personally did not like the lift... which becomes unavoidable though. Remember, there is no car at mall... so its critical to know the distance of your hotel from the lift. Secondly, you need to climb two floors at most hotels to reach your room.

Both above and below the Mall are other interesting streets worth exploring too.  The Upper and Lower malls with narrow streets filled with market traders.  The Mall itself has many interesting heritage buildings from Clarkes Hotel to the Gaiety Theatre and Town Hall.  The more exclusive shops also line this particular street - some international brands as well as local traders.  Even just to window shop or take an evening stroll, it's a pleasant activity.  Shimla is very clean, both in terms of litter and smoke free - the local council appear to work hard at encouraging good clean living habits to prevail out of doors here.  And, it would appear to be paying off.
No visit to Shimla would be complete without a few strolls along this promenade, and taking in the views down the valley along the way.  The Mall is more than just shopping, it's been the beating heart of Shimla for many decades and the town's social, economic and political history is captured in the buildings still standing today."

The daily humdrum of a metro life feels like a distant dream. Sitting on a stone  bench alone, among the crowd, strangely helps you to find yourself.  The crowd pass by, you  observe  their faces, feel  their emotions, their  happiness and their companionship,  all a true   revealation! A child shreiks excitedly sitting on a horseback,  a little girl happily running  around in the rain, the sudden cold wind brings in a  heavy hail storm and  everyone runs for cover. A young couple stand quietly, her head resting on the boy's shoulder, her hair caressing his face, an old lady enjoying an ice-cream, her husband lovingly holding an umbrella, a father holding a plate of momo's for his son. The green  hills  stand mesmerising,  white clouds gently shroud the valley  in a white veil, a Himalayan thrush erupts in a joyful song and  suddenly the sun breaks through  the dark clouds and  the  hillside shines brilliantly. The  panorama of the rolling hills is exhilarating,  a horde pigeons swiftly fly by, a solitary crow gently floats in the  wind, the air is filled with the smell of fresh pine cones, the memories of a lost fragrance becomes alive  and you feel a strange   peace! Slowly, the rain  stops and the evening sets in, the blue hills look enchanting from my window, sudden lightening brightens up the distant mountains and  the neon lights stand out like sta inrs in heavenly sky. And  a feeling of warmth runs  through,   you realize life is so beautiful! Random Musings of a rainy day in Shimla Hills."

The place is very accessible. The place is filled with small shops for souvenir shopping, to food explorations, to shawl shopping. The place is best to visit during the day, especially in winter time, as the place is huge and you'll probably spend about 3/4 hours covering the place, and most shops close around 8 pm at night during winter. 
There are many sight seeing places across the Mall Road area, so be sure to make a list of places you wanna go to, to get the most out of your time there. have lunch in some of the authentic indian restaurants and get desserts from the some of the street shops selling freshly made sweets.

It’s also lined with dozens of shops, from small grocery shops to big brand stores, restaurants, and so on. There are views across the hills, and trees along the way. 

Note that the Mall is a vehicle-free zone, so you have to walk all the way (this was about a 2 km walk either way from where we were staying, at the Oberoi Cecil). Wrought iron benches all along the way are good to sit down for a breather, if you need it. There are also vendors here and there who sell charred corn, cotton candy, and so on (but do note: there are lots of monkeys around, and they are liable to pounce on any food they see being carried by a passer-by: our daughter got her cotton candy snatched out of her hand by a monkey)."
