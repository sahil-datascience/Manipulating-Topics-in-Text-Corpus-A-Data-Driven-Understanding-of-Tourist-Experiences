The Mall extends the value and beauty of Shimla.
The Mall consists lots of administrative buildings and public service offices of valuable architecture. The design, shape and structure of buildings can make you think that you are in an European city. Don't miss to take these buildings pictures as these might not be found in any other places of india.

Also there are some temple in Mall. There is a very nice Christ Church and also the Ridge.The view from the Ridge is very scenic and you can feel the natural beauty of Shimla from there.

For shopping lovers, it is like a paradise. Lots of branded shops are available here. 

There is a lift and one can use that lift to go to the Mall.

One must visit this place in morning or afternoon as the buildings beauty can be felt in that time. Also one should visit this place in night when the place has different charms.

I visited this place in september,2010."

However if you are visiting for the 'n'th time, then this place has lost its charm.
Three friends walked around the mall road on a Sunday morning - afternoon with little to do. You can look at shops (warning - many branded shops like Tommy Arrows etc are shut on sundays). The local shops are too expensive (rates would suit only foreigners). The mall has lost its charm in a way. It has some very nice photography points which may interest you. 
Overall i suggest you spend not more than a couple of hours here and find some nice eating joints or trail off into the interiors instead. :)"

Since my late father was with the Punjab govt. of undivided India, we were in Shimla for almost 6 months of the year- getting there in early April and leaving Shimla in the end of Sept.6 months of my growing years, every year, were spent in Shimla.
 From 1938 to 1947 we were staying in the compound of Barnes Court, the summer house of the governor of Punjab of undivided India.
I had vivid memories of Shimla. My family, specially my older brother and sisters, used to recall the places we knew well in & around Shimla. 
In my last visit with my wife in 2004, I was pleasently surprised that most of the heretage places, were kept and maintained verywell. The Gaity theater was in the process of renovatin in the same shape and style.We were able to visit the HP, governor's place of residence (old Barnes Court) and see where the famous Simla agreement was signed by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto & Indra Ghandhi. So we have decided to visit Shimla again this summer instead of goving to USA or Europe for our holidays."

Shimla is a large working town and the Mall is primarily for their benefit.  So saying, it is nicely done with a broad-walk with interesting views on both sides.  At various points are the historical buildings renovated to maintain the heritage.  Additions are in the same design, so town planning here is important.  The Post Office looks like an English 1930s department store with a Scottish castle turret !?  It must be India, because you would never see that in UK. The turret builders must have been popular in Shimla in their day because you see these turrets elsewhere in the town. Other buildings are straight from Victorian Scotland.  The 'Scottish' kirk behind the Post Office is now an institute but still looks convincing.  The white 'English' church still functions and looks just as pleasant here as they do in countless places in UK.  Activities on the Mall are entertaining.  A warning:  be careful with your ice-cream because the monkeys like them too.  They will sit arrogantly on the walk casually enjoying the last one they have stolen.  Quick access to the Mall is via a lift or along the pleasant Ridgeway."

Shimla has very narrow, steep roads and you will be dropped off at a main roadway, which is far below the tourist area commonly called “the Mall”.  You need to take two lifts (elevators) to get up/down to and from the mall.  You will see a ticket booth that sells lift tickets for 7 Rps.  Buy a ticket to go up and then (at the top) buy one to come back down.  The elevators are crowded; there will be a lift attendant who will take your ticket.  The first lift stops half-way, you get off and then get onto a second lift to get to the Mall level.

The Lower Bazaar sells common items (household items, cloth, material) that an Indian person might want. There are staircases all along the bazaars, which you can take up or down, as desired.  On the Mall level you can shop for pashminas, cashmere shawls, carvings, gloves, hats, saris and many other items.  There are cafes to eat at (I would highly recommend Café Sol) as well as several places where you can buy sodas, ice cream, popcorn etc.  

The Ridge is the top level where you will find St Michael’s church.  The church is free to visit (you can make a donation inside) and has beautiful stained glass windows and interesting plaques on the wall (in memory of people who died long ago).  There is a promenade area where people walk, sit or even take horse rides."

The cost of items and restaurants start going up as compared to Lower Mall.. So explore The Lower Mall before You Buy anything from The Upper Mall... The HPTDC Runs a Lift to & from Lower Mall (Near Taxi Stand) to Upper Mall (Rs 8 One Way) which is a good way of saving oneself from tiring uphill climb especially on the way up. On The Upper Mall Road Near Scandal Point are Few Upmarket Restaurants ( Good Ambiance/Exorbitant Prices) and Some Good Bakeries. While on the Mall beware of the Touts of Tour Operators who will offer you all sorts of packages for Local as well as Kufri/Chail/Naldhera sightseeing and literally drag you to their shops and make you book/pay for a package before you know what happened. Best advice is sought from HPTDC Tourist Information Centre at The Scandal Point ( Beware of asking directions, instead of telling you where it is almost all shopkeepers/touts on road will start chatting you up to take their taxis/packages). All in All one can spend his time and money well eating/shopping on the Mall during his entire stay rather than spending it on Bogus sightseeing tours."

The Mall of Shimla","Not so long ago, when we were kids, Shimla was our annual pilgrimage! And Mall Road the deity ;) It was almost always teeming with leisure walkers, but it had a character not seen at any place else in India. It still retains that charisma. Though it is swarming, the sightseers maintain a certain politesse which I find extremely magical. It feels like a return to nostalgia, when you could spend your time doing the most diligent of all things: NOTHING!!

There are many a beliefs about the distance this stretch of road, but for me it starts from the Post Office and goes up to the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, or vice versa, depending on where I am staying- Grand or Combermere. An unhurried stroll to cover this breadth is the announcement I make to my mind and soul that finally it’s time to have a break! There is a reason for this: Driving from Delhi to Shimla is in itself as stressed out as living a 10AM-10PM life in the impossibly populous urban stink called Delhi.

All the major shops and departmental stores, restaurants and bakeries that make up this place are landmarks in their own rights. A few bigger ones are Diwan Chand Atma Ram Apparels, Alfa Restaurant, Indian Coffee House, Gainda Mal Hem Raj Departmental Store, Trishul Bakery, Baljees Sweetmeat, Café Sol…and a few others I am not naming so you can begin your nostalgic trip with me. 

The Christ Church at The Ridge can compete with Gateway of India as the most photographed monument in India. No tourist worth his phone camera can dare to announce a visit to Shimla on his Facebook wall without a flinty image of her on a horse with the church in the background, and Mahatma Gandhi’s watching with a benign smile from his podium.

The impressive roster of horses certifies that the kids of the family are excited to forego anything for a ride first. Check in the hotel and rush out to relish the Mall. That’s Shimla in succinct.

The Mall is an eternal fascination with me. Never once do I feel I am returning; each time is the first time, an untouched experience to treasure until the next visit!"

At the top end of the Mall is Scandal Point, a large open square with a view of the town- a favorite meeting for visitors and the local people. There is outstanding Christ Church, stands as the representative of the Shimla. We have enjoyed shopping, eating, sitting and roaming at The Mall. One who visit Shimla, must visit the Mall…"

It's the place to wander, to promenade and to soak up the atmosphere of the city. For many people it's the place to show off their wooly hats and thick coats as they enjoy what most of us Northern Europeans are far too used to - being cold. The shops? Well there's really nothing much to excite but if you look upwards, there are some super old buildings which I love to look at. In places it's extraordinarily cute - I love the teeny tiny 'sub-post office' which looks like something from a child's play set. The renovated Gaiety Theatre is an absolute star and is making the town hall next door look decidedly shabby.

If you're expecting something really special, you might be disappointed. This isn't about swanky shops and classy dining - it's just a place to plod slowly up and down, soaking up the atmosphere and getting used to the altitude."

By Indian standards, this upper part of Shimla has little traffic, is relatively clean, and surprisingly a ""smoke-free"" environment."

But then,the place has something about it which makes even this walk through the crowds fascinating.The old buildings exude a certain charm which adds to the experience.And if you're a foodie,you won't be disappointed as the whole road is dotted with eateries serving all kinds of cuisine.
   To summarise ,this is a place anyone going to Shimla will visit.When you go,go there with clear expectations.I don't think this is a place primarily for shopping(shopaholics please excuse )But if you really need something while you're in Shimla,this is the place to get it...and if you're someone with a penchant for taking a stroll enjoying people and the things around,this place is definitely for you...On  a personal note,i found it better than many of the so called attractions in Shimla"

Only if you are in mood to further shift into colder temperatures & have some fun in snow. Kalka is the nearest railhead from Shimla, KALKA SHATABDI express takes you from New Delhi to Kalka in almost 4.5 Hours. There are 2 shatabdis – one deaparting in the morning @007:40 hours, the other  @ 17:15 hours, both from New Delhi Railway station. There are good number of Volvo buses also plying between Delhi & Shimla. One can go ahead & get a bus booking done from Redbus.in or makemytrip.com. There are couple of other trains also running from Sarai Rohilla railway station to kalka but shatabdi  is the best train to travel in terms of time & conveniency. Once you reach Kalka, there are connecting Toy trains which can ferry you to Shimla in almost 5 hours. There are a host of toy trains , which gives sheer pleasure to children running past 103 tunnels, though the journey can be little boring for adults. If you happen to reach kalka at night by the evening shatabdi, you have toy trains like “Shivalik Deluxe ”, “Rail Motor”, “Himalayan Queen to take you to Shimla. If you reach kalka by the morning shatabdi, “himalyan queen” is the connecting toy train for the same. In winters, Northern Railways have big delays in train arrival & departure, so do not be shocked if Shatabdi departs 3-4 hours late & you miss the toy train. In that case, you get taxis from kalka to Shimla, small cars like Indica will charge you Rs.1600, bigger cars go upto Rs.3000. Generally, if you are in a big group, it is suggestible to hire a bigger car like a Qualis or innova. Shimla is a small city. It is the only city/Hill station in India which does not allow cars to come to the “Mall Road” – The most important market place & business centre of the city. Cars generally drop you near the bus stand. Even the railway station is nearest to the bus stand.  There are “lifts” available to carry you to the other parts of the city e.g the ridge. The city is divided into various elevations & for going into each part you can avail the lift facility. Normally, they charge Rs.100 to Indians for choosing the lift service. The other surprising part of Shimla one gets to see “Human Porters” who carry your luggage to the hotel. They also charge somewhere between Rs.100 –Rs.300 depending on the number of luggage & the distance that needs to be climbed up. Shimla has almost 300 hotels across various segments, Budget, Economy, Luxury. One can choose a hotel in Mall Road if he wants to live near the market place. In seasons, a deluxe room may cost you somewhere between Rs.2000- Rs.4000 in any of the hotels in Mall Road. If you do not want to shell out too much, you can choose hotels in the Ridge Area, Jakhoo temple road. A deluxe room for a night costs you Rs.800- Rs.1500 during the peak season. Hotel Wood land is a good choice. Doing an advance booking (a month ago) via makemytrip is suggestible .  Both YMCA & YWCA also offers cheap rooms at Rs.400 per night , but it is exclusively on first come first serve basis. One can divide Shimla trip into 2 parts. One complete day for local sight seeing, the other day to visit nearby areas like Kufri, Naldehra, Narkanda. Local Sightseeing attractions are Jakhoo temple (hanumanji temple), Shimla Church, Viceregal Lodge, Gaity Theatre, Institute of Advanced Studies, Mall Road. One can ask the hotel for local sight seeing tours. Or one can go to the “HIMACHAL PRADESH TOURISM’’ office located in Mall Road for booking local sight seeing tours. They charge you somewhere between Rs.50- Rs.100 per person in bus or tempo traveller. Kufri is located almost 21 kms from Shimla. Local tour operators/Hotels charge almost Rs.700 – Rs.1000 for half day Kufri, Faagu, Naldehra trip. Kufri is the nearest snow point to Shimla. On way to Kufri, you can see “Sanjauli” home to  Bollywood actress “Preity Zinta”. Enroute to Kufri, one can see “ Green valley”, home to various animals e.g snow leopard, bear, birds etc.  Snow patches starts on way to Kufri. Once you reach Kufri, one can hire “ponies” to go up to the Fagu valley. Please be careful negotiating on Pony Rates . As per the union, an average uphill & downhill journey taking you to Masu peak,  naag devta temple, Fun world & skiing point costs you Rs.380 per person. But due to increase in crowds, the horse riding exp. Is not good at all. The path uphill is a rocky terrain with one guy managing almost 4 horses. Once you reach Faagu valley, you can see China Border, The snow capped Himalayas . which is like a treat to the eyes. Do try out adventure sports like paragliding, rock climbing, skiing there. Also do not forget to taste “Maggi”, “Chane”  “Tea” & “ garam pakore” at Masu Peak. Children can get pictures clicked sitting on “Yaks” brought from Ladakh. One can also pose himself/herself wearing the local  costume “potu” available on Rent of Rs.100. Kufri, Faagu takes you half day & then you can be back at the hotel.

There are loads and loads of shops however it seemed that Shimla caters for mostly local tourists as 'normal' souvenirs are hard to come by. Also, we don't see any foreign tourist on the Mall Road! 

However, strolling along the few branches of the mall road, you will come across a road for cloths, kitchen utensils, clothings, woodwork etc. Coming from a tropical country and the unfortunately fact that I don't cook, I didn't buy anything except for a few keychains. But it is a pretty cool experience to see what the locals use for their daily lives. They do have some nice looking saree shops also. There are loads of restaurants and bakeries so eating here is not a problem. The servings are large so if you normally don't take 1.5 bowls of rice for your meal then I suggest that 2 persons to share one portion!  

Since it is a pedestrian road, the cars are usually parked much lower hence you will need to get onto a tourist lift to get onto Mall Road. We only had to take it once as we stayed in a hotel on the Mall Road, Hotel Willow Banks.

The lift is decades old and can fit about 7 people with luggage but it is a pretty tight squeeze. The drop off area to the lift is unfortunately filthy. You need to pay a nominal sum to get on the life, if I am not wrong INR8 and for senior citizens INR6. The first lift will take you to about 2/3 way up then you have to walk along a corridor to another lift  (and another queue) before you get to the Mall Road. 

The Mall Road goes up and down so if you are unfit or has knee or walking problem, this may not be a suitable place for you. But for people with toddlers, there are prams from rental along the road."

Until 1947 no Indians were allowed to walk on Mall Road except servants.  The Mall is most prettier than any other hill station.  The ancient buildings on its side gives the British era feeling which one will admire to the fullest.  Some of the buildings date back to 1905, 1890 etc.  The 'Nagar Palika' Bhavan is also very beautiful, though it is ill maintained by the Indians.  The English bureaucratic legacy is ill maintained by the Indians and it is very much evident here.  The 'Christ Church' is proudly situated at the corner of the Mall where the Sunday Prayers were held by the Viceroys of India. The Mall is at the most 1 Km long but the journey is of never lasting.  Every nook and corner is important in historical parlance.  The vehicles are not permitted on the Mall.  The scandal point is also very famous at the Mall.  The most attraction at the Mall are, The Christ church, Goofa and Ashiana Restaurent, BSNL building, Sagar Ratna Restaurent, Coffee House, HPTDC office, Nagar Palika Bhavan, Scandal Point, Gandhi Statue.  Spitting and smoking are not allowed on the Mall, ever caught with these bad habits, u will be fined very heavily.  Actually no one does mischievousness on the Mall due to its beauty."

The entire mall road looks like an open museum. The Ridge gives you a feeling of colonial India. The view of the beautiful Himalayan range and street food will keep you occupied for a few hours. You can also try horse ridding here, not very exciting though! There are not many cultural stores but you can still indulge in a little bit of shopping. Tibetan and Buddhist shops are mostly overpriced. The Mall is like a Connaught Place of New Delhi + better views!

Mostly flooded with tourists from nearby urban/semi-urban cities. My feeling is that there is not much one can do but then this depends on every individual! I'd like to appreciate the level of maintenance by local authorities. It is clearly visible that Himachal Government pays serious attention to tourism and it shows! Smoking is banned per government rule and there are plenty of sign boards to remind tourists about the same. Not just that, they have gone that extra step to provide trash bins at regular intervals.

There is a movie theatre too and just in case you have plans to catch a movie, avoid the night show! You can find almost everything you need, from food to alcohol. There are good bakery shops in the mall area and are usually crowded. Be careful with monkeys.

All in all, a good place for a day or two maximum! You like the place or you don’t, I leave that to you but do pay attention to basic travellers etiquette. Do not spoil the place!"

Both above and below the Mall are other interesting streets worth exploring too.  The Upper and Lower malls with narrow streets filled with market traders.  The Mall itself has many interesting heritage buildings from Clarkes Hotel to the Gaiety Theatre and Town Hall.  The more exclusive shops also line this particular street - some international brands as well as local traders.  Even just to window shop or take an evening stroll, it's a pleasant activity.  Shimla is very clean, both in terms of litter and smoke free - the local council appear to work hard at encouraging good clean living habits to prevail out of doors here.  And, it would appear to be paying off.
No visit to Shimla would be complete without a few strolls along this promenade, and taking in the views down the valley along the way.  The Mall is more than just shopping, it's been the beating heart of Shimla for many decades and the town's social, economic and political history is captured in the buildings still standing today."

We eventually purchased 2 down jackets which were in Woodlands sale at 50% off. We also purchased a few pairs of earrings from the government shop, they were very helpful there too. There is a good range of cafes/restaurants along the Mall to suit various tastes. Compared to the rest of India, this was about the cleanest street we had seen anywhere.

The daily humdrum of a metro life feels like a distant dream. Sitting on a stone  bench alone, among the crowd, strangely helps you to find yourself.  The crowd pass by, you  observe  their faces, feel  their emotions, their  happiness and their companionship,  all a true   revealation! A child shreiks excitedly sitting on a horseback,  a little girl happily running  around in the rain, the sudden cold wind brings in a  heavy hail storm and  everyone runs for cover. A young couple stand quietly, her head resting on the boy's shoulder, her hair caressing his face, an old lady enjoying an ice-cream, her husband lovingly holding an umbrella, a father holding a plate of momo's for his son. The green  hills  stand mesmerising,  white clouds gently shroud the valley  in a white veil, a Himalayan thrush erupts in a joyful song and  suddenly the sun breaks through  the dark clouds and  the  hillside shines brilliantly. The  panorama of the rolling hills is exhilarating,  a horde pigeons swiftly fly by, a solitary crow gently floats in the  wind, the air is filled with the smell of fresh pine cones, the memories of a lost fragrance becomes alive  and you feel a strange   peace! Slowly, the rain  stops and the evening sets in, the blue hills look enchanting from my window, sudden lightening brightens up the distant mountains and  the neon lights stand out like sta inrs in heavenly sky. And  a feeling of warmth runs  through,   you realize life is so beautiful! Random Musings of a rainy day in Shimla Hills."

Due to light drizzle the weather had become beautiful and perfect for such a visit. Didn't buy anything from here as most were brand showrooms.

You can reach the mall after parking your car and then take a lift opposite parking. If you are coming from Jakhu ropeway then just walk down the road for 5-7 min and you land on the mall. Must visit if you are in Shimla."

The Mall Road is that place for Shimla, it’s almost 2-3 km long and has shops and restaurants  lined up on one side and on the other side u have hotels and walkways and heritage buildings, 

It leads to the Ridge and the weather is very pleasant here in the evenings across months throughout the year, 

We have been regulars here and yesterday it snowed, it was a dream come true to walk on Mall Road in snow fall, 

The mall is accessible through two very well run lifts the place is very interesting with the hustle and bustle around.

The place is very accessible. The place is filled with small shops for souvenir shopping, to food explorations, to shawl shopping. The place is best to visit during the day, especially in winter time, as the place is huge and you'll probably spend about 3/4 hours covering the place, and most shops close around 8 pm at night during winter. 
There are many sight seeing places across the Mall Road area, so be sure to make a list of places you wanna go to, to get the most out of your time there. have lunch in some of the authentic indian restaurants and get desserts from the some of the street shops selling freshly made sweets.

This fine old stretch of road lives and breathes colonial Shimla, with many old buildings all along its stretch, from the Railway Board Building and the Police Assistance Room to the Gaiety Theatre and Christ Church. It’s also lined with dozens of shops, from small grocery shops to big brand stores, restaurants, and so on. There are views across the hills, and trees along the way. 

Note that the Mall is a vehicle-free zone, so you have to walk all the way (this was about a 2 km walk either way from where we were staying, at the Oberoi Cecil). Wrought iron benches all along the way are good to sit down for a breather, if you need it. There are also vendors here and there who sell charred corn, cotton candy, and so on (but do note: there are lots of monkeys around, and they are liable to pounce on any food they see being carried by a passer-by: our daughter got her cotton candy snatched out of her hand by a monkey)."

It's mostly shops selling overpriced tat sadly, there's a couple of places selling decent stuff but the vast majority isn't any kind of nice souvenir/memento to take back to your home country."

Weather was sunny and we took lift from the road after leaving our car. 
Lift costs only Rs 20 per person and Rs 10 per senior citizen. Two Lift are big and completes journey to mall road in two parts with same ticket . Two new small lifts also work . So a economic option. 
Once at mall road , you may opt for wheel chair if accompanied by a needy family member. For children also, options for wheel chair if there. So relax. They charge for it . 
On mall road there are plenty of options of food and street sellers for woolen garments for adults as well as children. You can spend more and more time here . Climate is so good that you are not tired. Cleanliness is maintained . If you go down from mall road, lot of options for daily use items . One may get good woolens at very cheap rate on bargain."

Its busy, busy, busy.  You do mix with, and are jostled by, the locals.  There are some interesting wall murals at and there are also some steps up to The Ridge, from which there are views of the surrounding town, but, to me, those are the only things which make it 'touristiy'"
