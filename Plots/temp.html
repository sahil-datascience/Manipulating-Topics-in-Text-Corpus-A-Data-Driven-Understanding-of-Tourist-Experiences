Also near the Ridge you can find a long row of little shops where a lot of different stuff is sold.

The daily humdrum of a metro life feels like a distant dream. Sitting on a stone  bench alone, among the crowd, strangely helps you to find yourself.  The crowd pass by, you  observe  their faces, feel  their emotions, their  happiness and their companionship,  all a true   revealation! A child shreiks excitedly sitting on a horseback,  a little girl happily running  around in the rain, the sudden cold wind brings in a  heavy hail storm and  everyone runs for cover. A young couple stand quietly, her head resting on the boy's shoulder, her hair caressing his face, an old lady enjoying an ice-cream, her husband lovingly holding an umbrella, a father holding a plate of momo's for his son. The green  hills  stand mesmerising,  white clouds gently shroud the valley  in a white veil, a Himalayan thrush erupts in a joyful song and  suddenly the sun breaks through  the dark clouds and  the  hillside shines brilliantly. The  panorama of the rolling hills is exhilarating,  a horde pigeons swiftly fly by, a solitary crow gently floats in the  wind, the air is filled with the smell of fresh pine cones, the memories of a lost fragrance becomes alive  and you feel a strange   peace! Slowly, the rain  stops and the evening sets in, the blue hills look enchanting from my window, sudden lightening brightens up the distant mountains and  the neon lights stand out like sta inrs in heavenly sky.

The place is full of positive energy as the local people carry on with their daily affair. Children nicely groomed and dressed in uniform walking all the way through the mall to their schools on the ridge (no vehicles, not even bicycles in this area) look cheerful with their pink cheeks. Some little grown ups stop by for a cricket match of 2 overs to give themselves a few minutes of break to scale next elevation of walk. No sleepy or dull faces, they look brimming with enthusiasm. Watching people passby, some taking a stroll, some going for their work, seniors chit-chatting and flipping through newspaper, all are relaxed but motivated. A porter finds enough strength to load 2 filled indane gas cylinders on his back but not beg or steal, I have not seen a beggar here yet. While they intend to reach their destination in time, they find time to greet and stop for a minute of conversation if any one known comes across. As the Indian flag flies high at the ridge, the place as cleanly maintained as this, with natural beauty around, cultured and respectful people, this is a true salute to the spirit of flag and statues it hoists. While the beautiful views of the valley from the ridge and shopping across the mall are well known tourist attractions, this experience of just watching the life move on in this beautiful town of Shimla has been amazing and really rejuvenating. As the day passes and sun brightens, people may get to deal with the challenges in their lives, but I am sure they lift themselves up with great spirit every next morning. While we may see very beautiful places in the world, the wonderful people make of beautiful experience and I have just had one today morning. As the 10am siren sounds loud and mall road shop shutters open up, I get up from my bench with by now emptied four tea cups and head back to my hotel to accomplish my tourist sightseeing targets for the day with my family, probably including more touristy, over-crowded ridge in the evening with many hawkers around."],"thought_2":["i hv been a fan of The Mall road in Shimla all my adult life, & perhaps this is a partial review, but where else do u get the chance to shop, eat and ogle to ur heart's content while taking a lazy stroll in one of the most pleasant environs?"],"prob":["peopl, see, realli, look, stroll, make, full"],"frex":["alway, watch, look, peopl, effort, appreci, realli"],"lift":["convers, -crowd, affair, appreci, beggar, buildingsgreat, contemporari"],"score":["peopl, realli, awesom, look, watch, alway, make"],"proportion":["0.05"]},{"name":["walk, around, nice, time, even, visit, place"],"children":[{"name":["nice, spend, roam, whole, around, hang, love"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[3],"thought_1":["Nice place to spend some time..
